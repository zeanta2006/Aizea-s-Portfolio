            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>The work of Nigerian Photographer, Oghenekome Aizeanta Oke has appeared in local museums and also around surrounding countries, among other publications. Her recent shoot ''Capturing life in black and white: a grandfathers legacy'', explores an inclusive vision of beauty in a colorless world, trying to tell the story of how humanity is being drained of its once vibrant self. Including a link to purchase these images ensures that visitors unable to come for the next showcase will still be able to see the beauty of the work.</p>
            <p>Artist Oghenekome "Aizeanta" has had a strong passion for photography since a very young age. She began her little dream in her final year of secondary school. She hopes to inspire the younger generation to tell stories through their creatives.</p>
